Easy Theming: Uses CSS Custom Properties (variables) for straightforward customization of colors, fonts, and spacing.

Sticky Header: The navigation bar remains at the top of the screen on scroll for easy access.

Iconography: Integrates Font Awesome for easy use of high-quality icons.

Professional Typography: Uses the "Inter" font from Google Fonts for excellent readability.

Output
Customization
Customizing the look and feel of the website is simple.

Changing Colors
All primary colors are defined as CSS variables at the top of the <style> section. To change the site's theme, simply update these values.

:root {
    --primary-color: #007bff; /* Change this for the main brand color */
    --dark-color: #343a40;    /* Change this for the footer/text color */
    --card-bg: #ffffff;      /* Change this for the card background */
    /* ... and so on */
}

Changing Fonts
The "Inter" font is imported from Google Fonts. To use a different font:

Go to Google Fonts.

Choose a new font and get its import URL.

Replace the existing <link> in the <head> section with the new one.

Update the font-family property in the body style rule:

body {
    font-family: 'Your New Font', sans-serif;
}

Updating Content
All content is located in the <body> section of the HTML. You can edit the text in the headers, paragraphs, cards, and footer directly.

Navigation Links: Modify the <li> elements within the <nav class="main-nav">.

Showcase/Hero Section: Change the <h1> and <p> inside <section class="showcase">.

Main Content: Edit the <article class="card"> elements.

Sidebar: Update the content within <aside class="sidebar">.

File Structure Overview
The entire website is contained within a single HTML file for simplicity.

<head>: Contains metadata, links to Google Fonts and Font Awesome, and all the CSS within the <style> tags.

<body>: Contains the visible content of the page.

<header class="main-header">: The top navigation bar and logo.

<section class="showcase">: The main hero image and welcome text.

<div class="content-area">: The main section holding the articles and sidebar.

<footer class="main-footer">: The bottom section with social links and copyright info.

<script>: A small JavaScript block at the end of the <body> that controls the hamburger menu functionality.
